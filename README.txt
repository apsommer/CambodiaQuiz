    Hello,

        The two review recommendations have been incorporated.
        1. Both incorrect and correct checkboxes are identified in Question 1.
        2. A conditional including an else statement was added to the logic of the Toast message.

    Hello,

        This project was created on the following device.
        Sony E5823 Android 7.1.1, API 25
        The ImageButton (as the Cambodian flag) uses a selector to change between pressed and unpressed states.
